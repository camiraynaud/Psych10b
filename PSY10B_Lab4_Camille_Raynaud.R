#Based on this CI, can you reject the null hypothesis that Î¼Agr = 3? 
#Yes the null hypothesis can be rejected
#Why or why not? Type your answer as a comment on your script.
#The sample confidence interval 3.78, 4.08 does not contain 3 so the null hypothesis is rejected
#the p value is less than the significance level
